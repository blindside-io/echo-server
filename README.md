# Echo server

### A Project for Blindside.io

Echo Server is a tiny Go application that listens for TCP connections and echos back whatever is typed up to the first new line and then closes the connection. It's primary purpose is to demonstrate simple networking in the "A Practical Guide for Docker" on [Blindside.io](https://blindside.io).
